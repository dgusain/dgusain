- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I developed a cost-effective human vape simulation device for biomedical research, which performs on par with industry-standard equipment costing $45,000.

### About Me

I am a Master of Science graduate specializing in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Buffalo. My work integrates traditional image and signal processing with contemporary deep learning models to explore the impact of binaural beats on human attention span. My research includes EEG signal processing, variational autoencoders, and CNN+LSTM models. I am passionate about employing deep learning technologies to advance scientific discovery and solve complex biomedical problems.

### Projects and Experience

- **EEG Processed Functional Brain Networks**: Developed deep learning models to measure attention span using EEG signals.
- **Mechanized Inhaling Smoking Tool (MIST)**: Created a cost-effective vape simulation device for biomedical research.
- **Human Pose Estimation**: Used CUDA and CuDNN in GPU-accelerated ML models to generate 3D body models for occupational hazard therapy.
