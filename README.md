- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and neuroscience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning quantization of large language models like GPT-2, Stable-LM-Zephyr, Google Gemma-2, TinyLLama etc., 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving deep learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction, and for entry-level industry roles.
- 📫 How to reach me: [dgusain@buffalo.edu](mailto:dgusain@buffalo.edu)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I developed a cost-effective human vape simulation device for $300 in biomedical research, which performs on par with industry-standard equipment costing $45,000, increasing my team's efficiency by 200%. 

### About Me

I am a Master of Science graduate specializing in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Buffalo. My work deals in developing and fine-tuning models for real world applications, including multimodal AI and LLM quantization using TensorRT, for edge deployment, to solve complex challenges in speech-language processing, financial forecasting, and behavioral analysis. I am committed to leveraging innovative AI solutions to drive impact in dynamic and growth-oriented organizations

### Projects and Experience
- **Thera-Misty: Multimodal AI for Speech Language Therapy**: Quatization of LLMs using TensorRT, Hugging-Face Optimum for speech-language processing. Benchmarked existing LLMs against memory footprint, efficiency, quality (BERT score, METEOR score, Distinct-N)
- **Deal-no-Deal: LLM empowered stock market predictor**: Employing Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) architecture with Facebook FAISS to LLaMa-3 (8b, 70b) models for financial forecasting.
- **NeuroBeatsDL: Reconstructing EEG Processed Functional Brain Networks**: Developed deep learning models (conditional GANs, VAE, CNN-LSTM) to predict brain neural activity in presence of binaural beats stimuli. 
- **Mechanized Inhaling Smoking Tool (MIST)**: Created a cost-effective vape simulation device for biomedical research.
- **Human Pose Estimation**: Used CUDA and CuDNN in GPU-accelerated ML models to generate 3D body models for occupational hazard therapy.
